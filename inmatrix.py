# Consider a m x n matrix of characters inmatrix. Identify and print a m x n binary matrix outmatrix based on the below logic:
# idenitfy the unique characters in inmatirx

# Input format:
# First line will contain number of rows m of inmatrix.
# The next m lines will contain the elements of inmatrix. Each line will
# have n elements separated by *Â»(comma).
# Read the input from standard input stream,
# Output format:
# Print each row of the outmatrix in a new line where row elements are
# separated by % (comma)
# Print the output to the standard output stream
# Sample Input:
# 3
# a b c A
# a f c f
# a f c A
# Sample Output:
# 1,0,1,0
# 0,0,0,0
# 1,1,0,1
